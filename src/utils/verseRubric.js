 * it — personRole (set independently in hymnLibrary.js from person_type

 *
 *  - `allSpeakerLabelsSuppressed` is the Agpeya book's whole-document "hide

 *    which is also set throughout the liturgies whenever a line repeats the
 *    previous speaker — keying on that would tint People lines in every
 *    service.
 *  - The hymn is titled "Litanies". Every People line in the Agpeya today
 *    already sits in one of the ten Litanies hymns (38 lines, none outside),
 *    so this changes nothing currently visible — it is here so a People line
 *    added to some other hymn later doesn't silently start colouring itself.

/**
 * Whole-document version of speaker-label suppression: walks every section
 * in document order (not each section in isolation), so a person-type
 * indicator only re-shows where the reader would actually perceive a new
 * hymn starting.
 *
 * The caller must pass only the sections/verses that are actually DISPLAYED
 * — already filtered for displayComments/displaySilentPrayers/bishopPresent
 * — since this function decides suppression purely among what's visible, it
 * never accounts for hidden verses/sections.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - The very first non-comment verse in the whole document always shows.
 *  - Walking forward, a verse's indicator is suppressed unless its resolved
 *    type differs from the most recently encountered non-comment verse's
 *    resolved type — comments (including silentComment) are entirely
 *    transparent to this tracking, skipped in either direction.
 *  - Crossing into a new section: if that section has a displayed title,
 *    the cycle restarts — its first verse always shows, regardless of what
 *    came right before. If the section has no displayed title, it reads as
 *    a seamless continuation of the previous section — the same "only if it
 *    changed" comparison carries straight through the boundary. The one
 *    exception: a section immediately following a Minimizable/Minimized
 *    hymn always restarts too, titled or not — a minimized hymn reads as
 *    optional/collapsible content, so whatever comes after it needs its own
 *    fresh indicator rather than silently inheriting the last speaker shown
 *    before the (possibly-collapsed) minimized hymn.
 *
 * Returns a Map from verse object to a suppress boolean, keyed by object
 * reference — verse objects are stable within one render pass, so callers
 * look their own verses up directly rather than by index.
 *
 * `forceSuppressAll`, when true, skips the whole walk and marks every verse
 * suppressed unconditionally — the Agpeya's own person-type indicators
 * (Priest:/Deacon:/etc.) are hidden by default (the Hours are meant to be
 * prayed by one person, so a speaker-role indicator has no audience to
 * address), but reappear when an Hour is opened as a subdocument from within
 * a liturgical service (Vespers/Matins/Liturgy), where those roles are real
 * again — see ServiceDocument.tsx's `suppressAllSpeakerLabels`.
